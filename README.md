# Lennard Jones Molecular Dynamics in C++

![Box of Lennard-Jonesium](extra/lj.png)

## About

Simulates Lennard Jonesium using Molecular Dynamics.

The program is written in C++ and requires [Boost](http://www.boost.org/)
libraries and development headers for reading the .ini file, Some of the classes
I use are based on my [libgmxcpp](https://github.com/wesbarnett/libgmxcpp)
library. xdrfile, included with libgmxcpp, is used in writing trajectory (.xtc)
files.

Current features:

* Andersen thermostat
* Velocity Verlet integrator
* Calculate RDF
* Calculate velocity distribution
* Neighbor lists
* Block error analysis

Reduced units are used. 

## Compiling

To compile simply do:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    make install

## Running

To run do:

    ljmd md.ini

If no file configuration file is specified, then the program attempts to open
'md.ini.' If the file you specify is not found, the defaults options are used
for the program (printed to the screen).

When running the program an initial configuration of
atoms is generated by randomly inserting them into the box according to the
specified density, ensuring that the atoms are not too close to each other. Then
then simulation begins.
