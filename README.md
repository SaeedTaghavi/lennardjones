# Lennard Jones Molecular Dynamics in C++

![Box of Lennard-Jonesium](lj.png)

## About

This program simulates "Lennard-Jonseium". It's mainly a tool for learning and
study. Use at your own risk. See `LICENSE` for more details.

The program is written in C++ and requires [Boost](http://www.boost.org/)
libraries and development headers for reading the .ini file, and xdrfile for
writing the trajectory to .xtc. Some of the classes I use are based on my
[libgmxcpp](https://github.com/wesbarnett/libgmxcpp) library.

Current features:

* NVE
* NVT (with Andersen)
* Calculate RDF
* Calculate velocity distribution
* Block error analysis (only on temperature, KE, and PE currently)
* Neighbor lists

Reduced units are used. 

## Compiling

To compile simply do:

    make

You may have to modify `Makefile` if you have libraries installed in a custom
location.

## Running

To run do:

    ./md md.ini

When running the program an initial configuration of
atoms is generated by randomly inserting them into the box according to the
specified density, ensuring that the atoms are not too close to each other. Then
then simulation begins.

## Configuration

Check out `md.ini` for some of the options in running the simulation. When you
run the program all of the options are printed to the screen, including ones you
did not specify in the .ini file (with their default values).

Tildesley's *Computer Simulations of Liquids*.
